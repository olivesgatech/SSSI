# Seismic Simulation, Survey, and Imaging (S3I)
## Purpose of S3I
  * Provides an easy MATLAB®-based library to simulate seismic imaging
  * Produces synthesized data for any given velocity model
  * Targets students as well as professionals in exploration geophysics
  * Provides an efficient implementation of the processing pileline for seismic imaging
  * Provides a platform to build other features such as interpretation and reservoir modeling
